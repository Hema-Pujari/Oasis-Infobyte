<center><p style="font-size: 20px ;" class="text-center">Lata Mangeshkar, the 'Queen of Melody', was born in 1929 in Indore, India, to a musical family. <br>
  She is a legendary Indian playback singer noted for her distinctive voice and a vocal range that<br>
  extended over more than three octaves. Her career spanned eight decades, and she recorded songs for<br>
  the soundtracks of more than 2,000 Indian films.She started singing at the age of five and made her<br>
  debut as a playback singer in 1942, at the age of 13. Mangeshkar’s father, Dinanath Mangeshkar, was a<br>
   noted Marathi stage personality popularly known as Master Dinanath. Lata, who was the eldest of five <br>
   siblings, was introduced to music at an early age.</p></center>
   <center><p style="font-size: 20px;">She recorded her first song at age 13 for Vasant Joglekar’s Marathi film Kiti Hasaal, though her song <br>
      did not make the final edit. Mangeshkar was trained from age five by her father, a disciple of the Gwalior <br>
      gharana (a community of performers who share a distinctive musical style), and she was also tutored by maestros <br>
      such as Aman Ali Khan Sahib and Amanat Khan. As a teenager, she struggled to help support her family and to establish<br>
     herself as a playback singer in the Hindi film industry of the 1940s, at a time when the profession was dominated by<br>
      such divas as Shamshad Begum and Noor Jehan.</p></center>
